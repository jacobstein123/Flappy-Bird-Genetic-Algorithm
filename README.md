A program that learns how to play flappy bird using a neural network trained with a genetic algorithm. After around 450 generations (with a population of 10 per generation) it can play the game much nearly perfectly, consistently achieving hundreds of points. The Flappy Bird pygame implementation was made and licensed by [Timo Wilken](https://github.com/TimoWilken/flappy-bird-pygame).
