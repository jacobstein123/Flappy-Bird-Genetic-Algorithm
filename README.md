A program that learns how to play flappy bird using a neural network trained with a genetic algorithm. After around 500 generations (with a population of 10 per generation) it can play the game nearly perfectly, consistently achieving tens of thousands of points. The Flappy Bird pygame implementation was made by [Timo Wilken](https://github.com/TimoWilken/flappy-bird-pygame).
